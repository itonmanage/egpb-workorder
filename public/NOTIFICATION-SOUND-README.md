# Notification Sound

This directory should contain a notification sound file named `notification.mp3`.

## How to add the sound file:

1. Find a notification sound (e.g., from https://notificationsounds.com/ or https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/)
2. Download an MP3 file
3. Rename it to `notification.mp3`
4. Place it in the `public` folder: `f:\ticket-form-app\public\notification.mp3`

## Recommended sound characteristics:
- Short duration (0.5-2 seconds)
- Pleasant, not jarring
- Clear and audible
- File size: < 100KB

## Alternative: Use a simple beep
If you don't have an MP3 file, you can use the Web Audio API to generate a beep sound instead.
